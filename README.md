# Description

This is a simple tool to encrypt and decrypt your file. In encrypting, the tool needs a passphrase (password) as input and a salt file (which would be auto-generated by the tool). Your passphrase would be hashed by [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt). To encrypt your file, the tool uses [the AES-256 encryption algoritm](https://www.n-able.com/blog/aes-256-encryption-algorithm).

## Usage

1. **Encrypt a file**
      ```
      $ ./let-us-lock encrypt -f {your path file} -o {your output file name}
      ```
2. **Decrypt a file**
      ```
      $ ./let-us-lock decrypt -f {your path file} -o {your output file name}
      ```
