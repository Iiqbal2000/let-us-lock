# Description

This is a simple tool to encrypt and decrypt your file. In encrypting, the tool needs a passphrase (password) as input and a salt file (which would be auto-generated by the tool). Your passphrase would be hashed by [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt). To encrypt your file, the tool uses [the AES-256 encryption algoritm](https://www.n-able.com/blog/aes-256-encryption-algorithm).

# Usage

```
$ ./let-us-lock -h
```

Output:
```
Usage of ./let-us-lock:
  -f string
        your file path which you want to encrypt/decrypt
  -m string
        encrypt/decrypt (default "encrypt")
  -o string
        your file output name
```
